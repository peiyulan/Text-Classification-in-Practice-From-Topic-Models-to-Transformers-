# Text Calssification in Practice: From Topic Models to Transformers

Welcome to the Readme file for the CDCS Workshop '**From Images to Text: Working with OCR**'. Below you can find all the details that you will need to get ready and attend this class.

## Overview

This course provides an overview of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), an image processing technique for extracting text from images.

The resource covers the following sections to help you learn and start to apply OCR in research practice:

- What is text extraction and OCR?
- What are the real-world application of OCR?
- What challenges might you face when using OCR and how can you address them?

We will practice implementing OCR using the following tools:

- Out of the box OCR software
- R and Python OCR modules
*Instructions for both R and Python are available in this GitHub repository. During the session, you will work in separate groups to implement the module that interests you most.

### **What do I need to know?**

This is a beginer-level workshop and does not require any prior programming knowledge or background of text extraction processes.

## **What will you need**

- A Laptop
- A WiFi Connection
- If you're new to R and Python, don't worry we have built the files and material that will allow you to visualise and play with the code for this class.
